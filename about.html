## About

I am a computer enthusiast, and I have continuously studied areas in IT that interest me. This has led me down all sorts of technical related paths. I enjoy using Linux and Windows to further my experience with both platforms. I have more recently been leaning heavily towards the Linux side in creating my home labs.

I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. We love the outdoors and are commonly found hiking, lost in the woods and playing disc golf.

The largest step in my career so far has been moving to Kansas City and obtaining my Linux+ and LPIC-1 certifications. I look forward to new employment in a new and awesome environment.
